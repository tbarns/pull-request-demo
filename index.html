    <h1> a modern monologue</h1>
    <p>
        Be quiet, Tiffany. Be quiet! What is wrong with you? STOP IT," the supermodel shouted. "I have never in my life yelled at a girl like this. When my mother yells like this it's because she loves me. I was rooting for you, we were all rooting for you! How dare you!"

        "Learn something from this! When you go to bed at night, you lay there and you take responsibility for yourself," Banks continued. "Because nobody's going to take responsibility for you. You rolling your eyes... it's because you've heard it all before."
        She added, "You don't know where the hell I come from. You have no idea what I've been through, but I'm not a victim. I grow from it and I learn. Take responsibility for yourself!"
